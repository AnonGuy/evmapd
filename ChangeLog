	* Release 0.0.3
	* --norm now accepts multiple comma-separated arguments
	* --verbose now reports any input axis that will be normalised
	* Fixed broken argument handling for the --norm parameter which rendered
	  the normalisation code useless and often caused a segmentation fault.
	  Apparently, the sample code in the the libcfg+ documentation is broken
	  as well, despite the actual documentation being correct, if only a bit
	  too short. No idea how this rather embarassing issue slipped through,
	  although its manifestation seems to be partly platform and/or compiler
	  dependent. Did I mention that libcfg+ could really use some better (as
	  in 'not broken') example code? (reported by Dave Ahlswede)
	* More verbose ioctl() error messages
	* Fixed incorrect KEY_MAX usage in ioctl(EVIOCGBIT) call, which would
	  produce a warning message by the kernel

Wed Jul  4 13:48:18 EEST 2007 - Theodoros V. Kalamatianos <nyb@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Release 0.0.2
	* Fixed signed/unsigned comparisons in the error handling paths
	* Always present a proper error message
