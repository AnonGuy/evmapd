1. Items in the ToDo list:

* Testing

* Write more documentation - a man page would be nice...

* Rework the code. Right now it's a mess. A real mess. The kind you don't
  really want to get into.

* More testing

* Configuration file for the mapping settings (?)

* More error checks - perhaps even some input validation

* A lot more testing

* More comments in the code

* And some more testing

* Get user feedback, perhaps some real use examples

* Charge $0.01 for every input event that passes through evmapd and become
  a billionaire.

* And, yes, you guessed it, more testing...
